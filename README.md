# data_collection_challenge

Contains two Python scripts to scrape information from web pages. 

Part 1 gathers and prints all articles from https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html.

Part 2 looks at Mars weather data from https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html. It then analyzes the data by answering specific questions via text, visualization, or both. It then exports the DataFrame of the Mars weather data that was scraped from the website into a CSV file in the same folder as the script as 'Mars_Weather_data.csv'.
